# Upgrading

Tracearr uses the `latest` Docker image tag by default, so upgrading is straightforward — pull the new image and recreate the container.

TimescaleDB and Redis are persisted in a volume, so your database and configuration will be preserved during the upgrade process.

## Docker Compose

This guide assumes you followed the [Quick Start](/getting-started/installation#quick-start) instructions to set up Tracearr with Docker Compose.

From the directory containing your `docker-compose.pg18.yml` file, run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.pg18.yml pull tracearr
docker compose -f docker-compose.pg18.yml up -d
```

This will:
1. Download the latest Tracearr image
2. Recreate the container with the new image
3. Preserve your database and configuration

If you are using a different compose file, make sure to update the commands accordingly.

### Cleaning Up Old Images

After upgrading, you can remove unused images to free up disk space:

```bash
docker image prune
```

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure to review the images being removed before confirming, as this will delete all dangling images.
