# Tracearr

**Real-time monitoring for Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby. One dashboard for all your servers.**

Tracearr is a free, open-source monitoring platform that gives you complete visibility into your media servers. Track streams in real-time, analyze playback patterns, and detect account sharing — all from a single interface.

## Why Tracearr?

If you run multiple media servers, you've probably dealt with this: Tautulli only works with Plex. Jellystat only works with Jellyfin and Emby. Multiple servers means multiple dashboards.

**Tracearr handles all three.** One install, one interface.
