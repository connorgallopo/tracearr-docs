# Mobile App

The Tracearr mobile app lets you monitor your media servers on the go. Available for iOS and Android.

## Enabling Mobile Access

Before you can pair devices, you need to enable mobile access on your Tracearr server.

<Steps>

### Open Settings

Go to **Settings** → **Mobile** in your Tracearr dashboard.

### Enable Mobile Access

Click **Enable Mobile Access**. This activates the pairing system and allows devices to connect.

### Set External URL (if needed)

If you're accessing Tracearr through a reverse proxy or remotely, go to **Settings** → **External URL** and set your public URL (e.g., `https://tracearr.yourdomain.com`). The mobile app uses this URL to connect.

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
Without an external URL configured, the QR code will contain your local network address, which won't work when you're away from home.
</Callout>

## Pairing a Device

You can pair up to 5 devices per Tracearr instance.

### QR Code (Recommended)

<Steps>

### Generate a Pairing Code

In **Settings** → **Mobile**, click **Add Device**. A QR code appears with a countdown timer.

### Open the Tracearr App

Launch the Tracearr app on your phone. On first launch, you'll see the pairing screen automatically.

### Scan the QR Code

Point your camera at the QR code. The app will automatically detect and pair with your server.

### Done

Once paired, you'll be taken to the dashboard. Your device now appears in the "Connected Devices" list on the web.

</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
The pairing token expires after **5 minutes** and can only be used **once**. If it expires, click "Add Device" again to generate a new code.
</Callout>

### Manual Entry

If you can't scan the QR code:

1. In the mobile app, tap **Enter URL and Token Manually**
2. Enter your **Server URL** — e.g., `https://tracearr.yourdomain.com`
3. Enter the **Access Token** — shown below the QR code, starts with `trr_mob_...`
4. Tap **Connect**

## Push Notifications

The mobile app supports push notifications for real-time alerts.

### Enabling Notifications

1. In the app, go to **Settings** → **Notifications**
2. Toggle **Enable Push Notifications**
3. Grant notification permissions when prompted by your device

### Notification Events

You can enable or disable notifications for each event type:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Violation Detected** | A sharing rule was triggered |
| **Stream Started** | Someone started watching |
| **Stream Stopped** | Playback ended |
| **Concurrent Streams** | User exceeded stream limit |
| **New Device** | New device detected for a user |
| **Trust Score Changed** | User's trust score degraded |
| **Server Down** | Media server became unreachable |
| **Server Up** | Media server is back online |

### Violation Filters

When violation notifications are enabled, you can filter by:

- **Rule Type** — Impossible Travel, Simultaneous Locations, Device Velocity, Concurrent Streams, Geo Restriction
- **Minimum Severity** — All, Warning & High only, or High only

### Quiet Hours

Pause non-critical notifications during sleeping hours:

1. Enable **Quiet Hours**
2. Set your start and end times (e.g., 11 PM to 8 AM)
3. Optionally enable **Override for Critical** to still receive high-severity violation alerts

### Rate Limiting

To prevent notification spam, the app enforces rate limits:
- Maximum notifications per minute
- Maximum notifications per hour

You can see your current rate limit status in the notification settings.

## Managing Connected Devices

In **Settings** → **Mobile** on the web dashboard:

### View Connected Devices

Each device shows:
- **Device Name** — e.g., "John's iPhone"
- **Platform** — iOS or Android
- **Last Seen** — When the device last connected
- **Connected Date** — When it was paired

### Revoke a Device

Click the trash icon next to a device to disconnect it. The device will need to pair again with a new token.

### Revoke All Sessions

Click **Revoke All** to disconnect every device at once. Useful if you suspect unauthorized access.

### Disable Mobile Access

Click **Disable Mobile Access** to turn off the feature entirely. All devices will be disconnected and the pairing system will be disabled.

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid QR code" or "Pairing Failed"

- The token may have expired (5-minute limit) — generate a new one
- Ensure your phone has a clear view of the QR code
- Try manual entry instead

### App Can't Connect to Server

- Verify your **External URL** is set correctly in Settings
- Check that your server is accessible from outside your network
- Ensure HTTPS is working if you're using it
- Check your firewall allows incoming connections

### Not Receiving Push Notifications

1. Check that notifications are enabled in the app settings
2. Verify your device's notification permissions for Tracearr
3. Use **Send Test Notification** to verify the connection
4. Check that you haven't hit rate limits

### Device Shows "Last seen" a Long Time Ago

The app updates its "last seen" timestamp when it connects to fetch data. If the app hasn't been opened recently, this is normal.

### Can't Add More Devices

The default limit is 5 devices. You'll need to remove an existing device before adding a new one.
