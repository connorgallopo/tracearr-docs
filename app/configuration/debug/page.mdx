# Debug Page

Tracearr includes a debug page at `/debug` for troubleshooting and advanced maintenance. This page is not linked from the main navigation — access it directly at:

```
http://your-tracearr:3000/debug
```

## System Information

The debug page displays real-time system stats:

- **Node.js version**, platform, and architecture
- **Uptime** — how long Tracearr has been running
- **Memory usage** — heap and RSS memory consumption
- **Environment variables** — sanitized view of configuration

## Database Statistics

View database health and size information:

- **Record counts** — sessions, violations, users, servers, rules, library items
- **Database size** — total storage used
- **Table sizes** — breakdown by table and TimescaleDB aggregates

## Logs (Supervised Only)

If running the `supervised` image, the debug page includes a Log Explorer for viewing PostgreSQL, Redis, and application logs directly in the browser.

You can also access logs via CLI:

```bash
docker exec tracearr cat /var/log/supervisor/tracearr-error.log
```

Available log files in `/var/log/supervisor/`:

| Log File | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| `tracearr.log` | Application stdout |
| `tracearr-error.log` | Application errors |
| `postgres.log` | PostgreSQL stdout |
| `postgres-error.log` | PostgreSQL errors |
| `redis.log` | Redis stdout |
| `redis-error.log` | Redis errors |
| `supervisord.log` | Supervisor process manager |

<Callout type="info">
Set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` in your environment for verbose application output.
</Callout>

### Standard Docker Logs

If running the standard `latest` image with separate containers, use standard Docker log commands:

```bash
docker logs tracearr          # Application logs
docker logs tracearr-postgres # Database logs
docker logs tracearr-redis    # Cache logs
```

### Proxmox VE LXC Logs

If running in a Proxmox VE LXC, use standard systemd journal commands:

```bash
journalctl -u tracearr   # Application logs
journalctl -u postgresql # Database logs
journalctl -u redis      # Cache logs
```

## Snapshot Management

View and clean up library snapshots. Useful for removing suspicious or corrupted snapshot data that may affect Library Growth charts.

## Maintenance Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Refresh Aggregates** | Manually refresh TimescaleDB continuous aggregates |
| **Clear Stuck Jobs** | Reset jobs that show "already running" but aren't progressing |

<Callout type="info">
Use **Clear Stuck Jobs** when a maintenance job in Settings → Jobs says "already running" but shows no progress. This clears stale job state from a previous crash.
</Callout>

## Danger Zone

<Callout type="error" title="Destructive Actions">
These actions permanently delete data and cannot be undone. Use with caution.
</Callout>

| Action | What it deletes |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Clear Violations** | All violation records |
| **Clear Rules** | All detection rules and their violations |
| **Clear Termination Logs** | All stream termination history |
| **Clear Library Cache** | All library metadata and snapshots |
| **Clear Sessions** | All session history, violations, and termination logs |
| **Clear Users** | All non-owner users and their associated data |
| **Clear Servers** | All servers (cascades to users, sessions, violations, library) |
| **Factory Reset** | Everything except your owner account — returns Tracearr to initial setup state |
