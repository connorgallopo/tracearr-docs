# Connect a Server

After installing Tracearr, you'll connect your first media server during the initial setup.

## Initial Setup

When you first access Tracearr, you'll be prompted to sign in or create an account.

### Plex (Recommended)

1. Click **Sign in with Plex**
2. A popup opens — sign in with your Plex account
3. Tracearr discovers your Plex servers automatically
4. Select the server you want to monitor
5. You're done — Tracearr begins tracking sessions

<Callout type="info">
Plex servers must be owned by (or shared with admin access to) the Plex account you sign in with.
</Callout>

   - **Server URL** — e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8096`

## Getting API Keys

### Jellyfin

1. Open Jellyfin and go to **Dashboard** → **API Keys**
2. Click the **+** button to create a new key
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Tracearr")
4. Copy the generated key

### Emby

1. Open Emby and go to **Dashboard** → **API Keys**
2. Click **New API Key**
